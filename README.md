I am a 3rd year high school student, at SESI/SENAI Moinho, in Joinville – SC, studying Systems Development.
I am interested in technology, programming and development of solutions, always seeking to learn and evolve both technically and practically. I was born on 03/30/2009, on the date of writing this text I am 16 years old, the creation of this profile was based on publication needs so that my teachers can see my technical course work.
